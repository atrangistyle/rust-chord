NOTES : rust


void main (int a, int b) {
  } -- in C

fn main(a: int, b: int) -> void {
} -- in Rust

Example 
fn add (a: int, b: int) -> int {
  return a+b;
}
add(2, 3);

Rust doesn't have garbage collector. ownership, borrowing, lifetimes are three main concepts in it.
- any variable can be stored in stack or heap
- if a variable size is known upfront, it will be stored in stack
- so int will be stored in stack
- cargo - build tool for Rust
- cargo.toml, which is where all the dependencies are defined for Rust, [Cargo run, ]
